# Home-Automation-using-TSOP-Sensor
Home Automation using TSOP sensor

This project provide a cheap product to the common man so that they can make their home automated without smartphones and without any knowledge of technical things.
We have used IR Sensor so that all devices controlled by remote.To achieve this TSOP sensor is responsibile to catch the IR ray's.
Also TSOP sensor is less expensive as compare to bluetooth and wifi.

⦁	Objective :
Energy and money saving:
By controlling devices which are not in use, this saves energy and contribution towards “save energy save the earth”. 
Less the energy consumption less the electricity bill. Make human begins life easy and happy.

⦁	IR based home automation helps to save energy by controlling various devices which are not in use. 
It reduces the efforts to turn on and off devices by going physically near the switch box and switch off/on.
